# Goals of the Project: 

We are given the historical price of six stocks on a second basis from day 1 to day 365. For each stock, we are
asked to predict its volatility, whose meaning should be defined in our own terms. This paper summarizes the
analysis of the data and the algorithm used to create predictions.
